# PersianCode2C_Compiler

This compiler is a project that I developed during my Bachelor's studies as part of my Compiler course in 2002.

## Introduction

This compiler is designed to convert code written in Persian (Farsi) to equivalent C code. It was developed as a learning project to understand the intricacies of compiler design and implementation.

**Note:**
Due to the use of DOS Persian encoding, which relied on an ASCII table that is no longer available, reading Persian files created with this encoding might not be possible on modern Windows systems.

## Compiler Phases Implemented

1. Lexical Analysis
2. Syntax Analysis
3. Semantic Analysis
4. Intermediate Code Generation
5. Code Optimization (Not implemented)
6. Code Generation
